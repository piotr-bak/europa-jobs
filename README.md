This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

##  Running the project

```bash
npm  run  dev

# or

# or

pnpm  dev

# or

bun  dev
```

  

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## The Design
(Color palette)

## The Implementation
(Tailwind: Breakpoints)
(Why login button is a separate component)
(Types: reflecting the API structure - mostly)
(Revalidate interval on fetch)
(simplified approach to html parsing)
(API seem to wrok differently for English and for all other languages)
(API - Cities!!)
